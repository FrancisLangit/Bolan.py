# Bolan.py

Bolan.py is a clone of Google Chrome's well-known [Dinosaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game) written on Python 3 using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) game development framework. 

## Background

### Gameplay

The player takes control of a T-Rex running across an infinite desert. The main objective is for the player to keep alive as long as possible by pressing the space key to avoid the Cacti that come their way. Points are continually scored until the player collides with an obstacle, upon which the game ends and they may restart the game to attain a higher score. 



### Why did you name it "Bolan.py?"

Inspiration was taken from Google's development of the original Chrome game. Before the browser game was released, [Google gave the project the codename "Project Bolan,"](https://thenextweb.com/dd/2018/09/07/4-years-later-google-finally-explains-the-origins-of-its-chrome-dinosaur-game/), naming it after [Marc Bolan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Bolan), the lead singer of the 1970's band, [T-Rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rex_(band)). As such, while the game is more often referenced today as the "Dinosaur Game," "T-Rex Game," or "Dino Runner," this project's name, "Bolan.py," was chosen to honor its parent's past pseudonym.
